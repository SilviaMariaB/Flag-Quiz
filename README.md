# Flag-Quiz

Making a flag quiz app in order to learn how to work with postgres.

Microsoft Windows does not natively display the images of flags and you won't see flags in VS Code or pgAdmin. Instead, Windows will show you the country code. As a Windows user, the easiest way to complete upcoming country flag quiz project is to simply use the Mozilla Firefox browser (instead of Chrome). Firefox displays flags just fine, compared to Google Chrome where the code will be displayed.
